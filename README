This repository contains the code and data for numerically calculating the reproduction rate of each differentiation strategy and the simulation for developmental trajectories of strategies of interest. 
The repository has three main parts: code for searching for optimal strategies at given parameters, data for saving the optimal strategies under varying parameters, and code for analyzing the data and producing figures.
The file "dynamic_heatmap.py" is used to calculate the optimal strategy under parameters b, c, alpha, beta, and n.
The file data stores the features of optimal strategy under varying conditions.
The files "*Fig*" are the files that generate figures.
Please see the numerical calculation of the reproduction rate in the manuscript.
All the codes are written using Python language (version 3.6).
